SONATA

An FTL mod.

With cries of "Sic Semper Tyrannis", nearly a quarter of the United Empire's worlds have seceded to form their own nation. They call themselves the "Pilgrims". The Empire's legislature interpreted this secession as treason, and the overwhelming might of the loyalist fleet has fallen on the Pilgrims. Although the situation is militarily hopeless, your family and friends have all joined the resistance - and so you shall.

This mod is based on the storyline of Endless Space by Amplitude Studios, with modifications.

NOTE: It is highly recommended to use Splette's Higher-Res Backgrounds mod in conjunction with Sonata. Make sure that Higher-Res Backgrounds is loaded BEFORE Sonata in GMM.

1 RACES
UNITED EMPIRE
The United Empire is a liberal democracy, the capital being Earth; the vast majority of humans are citizens, as well as many aliens. The Empire, in fact, is quite liberal - and there is widespread sexual liberalism, drug use, and body modification. Its government presides over a population which is fiercely proud and expansion-hungry to the point of jingoism. 
 
The United Empire uses kinetic weaponry: rail guns, gauss guns, and drivers. Drivers tend to fire more quickly than the other types.

PILGRIMS
What does it take to drive an entire planet to secede from the United Empire, to seemingly turn their back on their race? In the case of the Pilgrims, it was shame. Shame at being part of an Empire that laughed at the gods, the Endless. Shame at being part of an Empire that allowed hedonism, all sorts of absolute moral depravity, within its borders. Shame, truth be told, at an Empire that would manipulate and conquer other children of the Endless to accomplish its goals.

In any case, almost 40% of the worlds of the United Empire seceded in the space of one year. This 40%, however, only included around 15% of the Empire's population, and an even smaller fraction of its industrial capability. The Pilgrim situation is militarily hopeless, although the Sophon (and a sizeable portion of the UE legislature) are seeking a ceasefire.

The Pilgrims use the same weapons that the United Earth and most other humans do.
 
SOPHON
The Sophon are a race of highly intelligent, highly cultured scientists with little actual government that seem to do just fine, nevertheless. Relations between the Sophon and humans have always been at least cordial, and usually are quite friendly; the Sophon government has elected not to recognize the Pilgrims diplomatically in interests of their relationship with the United Empire, but are certainly not on bad terms with the Pilgrims. Most Sophon are concerned with nothing but researching the hell out of whatever pleases them.

The Sophons use beam and pulse lasers.

SOWER
The Sower were created by an ancient race of beings called the Endless as advanced robotic terraformers, preparing worlds for future colonization. The Endless have long since disappeared, but these immense robots still fulfill their programming. Whether individual Sower - or possibly the race as a whole - are merely intelligent or actually sentient is unknown.

The Sower use massive cannon and autocannon.

ENDLESS
An ancient race of beings with godlike technological prowess, long extinct. Many religions believe that they created the races that now populate the galaxy, or at least some of them: the Sower and Sophon. It is accepted as fact that the Endless created Dust, the miraculous material used for currency and technology across the galaxy. Humans are sharpely divided: some, including the Pilgrims, believe that the Endless created humans and worship them as gods. Some humans don't believe that. 

A sizeable fraction of humanity looks at the Endless, and think "give us a thousand years, and we'll do better than that." Do I detect a whiff of manifest destiny? This goes a long way to explain the United Empire's foreign policies.
