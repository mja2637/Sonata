Remove Engi???

So just:
UE
Pilgrim
Sophon
Hissho
Sower

Maybe:
Automaton as Engi (MINOR role)
Crystal->Swarm?
Slug->Amoeba?

No:
Horatio
IHTG as faction
Craver (mostly)
Automaton
Amoeba



Need events:
- UE losing will to fight Pilgrim secession
- You defeat the most war-hungry admiral's dreadnought
- Pilgrims are allowed to begin, uh, a pilgrimage
- Sophon mediated?


Events files:
events.xml - Seems like generic events than can happen in any sector, as well as civilian sector events. Editing here will improve the atmosphere of the mod greatly. Human/Sower/Sophon references changed already.
events_nebula - Deals w/ the obvious; these events are fairly common and so key for mod atmosphere. References changed already.
events_pirate
events_rebel
events_ships
events_imagelist
events_boss


events_rock
events_zoltan


events_mantis - Mantis sector events & ship unlock. Surprisingly short/little in there. References changed already but needs to be converted to Hissho. Lots of lore work to be done/added.
events_engi - Engi sectors & depicts the war between Mantis and Engi. Will be updated to depict a Hissho conquest-in-progress (I think, atm).

events_fuel - Random events that occur when you're out of fuel. Probably very little point to further modification. It looks like there are some sector-specific events as well. Human/Sower/Sophon references changed already.

events_crystal - "Unknown" sector events. Will be changed to deal with the Cravers.
events_slug
