<event name="START_BEACON_BOSS">
	<text>The Pilgrim home fleet and the massive ship that carries the Pilgrim Council are just a few jumps away from here. Get there quickly.</text>
</event>

<!-- the first time you arrive at the base, before the rebel fleet arrives -->
<event name="FEDERATION_BASE">
	<fleet>fed</fleet>
	<text>You arrive at the heart of the last Pilgrim fleet - all the other fleets have long since been crushed. After confirming your identity and mission, you are immediately conveyed to the Council, to whom you present the sealed envelope. </text>
	<choice>
		<text>Read it.</text>
		<event>
			<text>The Sophon are attempting to broker a ceasefire between the Pilgrims and the United Empire. You had no idea that the United Empire had agreed to this; the Council must have been in back-channel talks with Sophon for some time now. The social party in the Empire legislature has finally managed to force a vote on the issue of secession, and they stand a solid chance at winning.</text>
			<choice  hidden="true">
				<text>Continue.</text>
				<event>
					<text>Negotiations are surprisingly quick through a Sophon proxy. All hostilities will cease galaxy-wide for a period of 2 months, until the vote has been made, starting at 0500 hours the next morning. Until that time, no new offensive actions shall be conducted.</text>
					<choice  hidden="true">
						<text>Continue.</text>
						<event>
							<text>A great load suddenly lifts from your shoulders. You figure you can take your time to refuel and repair the ship, get some R and R, maybe follow up on that one Sophon captain - but before you can finish the thought, warning klaxons sound.</text>
							<choice  hidden="true">
								<text>An attack!? That's not very sporting.</text>
								<event>
									<text>An entire UE expeditionary fleet has exited from FTL a few jumps away - the premier fighting unit in the galaxy. Frigates and destroyers surrounding a well-armed command and control ship. You sprint to your ship. Survive.</text>

<event name="BOSS_AUTOMATED">
	<text>Leaking air and littered with bodies, you are stunned that the Mahan is still fighting as hard as ever. You have the mental image of its Admiral standing alone at the conn, shaking his fist at the devil, but have no way of knowing if that's the truth.</text>
</event>

<event name="BOSS_DESTROYED">
	<text>The UES Mahan shudders, as if shaken by a giant, and after a flash of light she's gone. The battle will rage for hours yet, but this Empire fleet is beaten. As for the Pilgrims...only time will tell.</text>
	<unlockShip id="4">An advanced Pilgrim destroyer has been unlocked and can be found in the hangar!</unlockShip>
	<choice>
		<text>Continue...</text>
		<event>
			<text>Thanks for playing Sonata 7! - Matt Alioto</text>
		</event>
	</choice>
</event>

<event name="BOSS_ESCAPED">
	<text>After one last devastating barrage from your ship, one of Mahan's escorts are torn apart by multiple internal explosions. As you veer away to avoid them, the Mahan manages to jump away. Without one of its escorts, it will have to get closer to the base to be a threat. You've bought some time, but you've got to keep up the assault!</text>
	<autoReward level="HIGH">standard</autoReward>
</event>


<event name="BOSS_TEXT_1">
	<text>There she is, the UES Mahan - all 350,000 tons of her. It's the Admiral's flagship, and if he goes down you might have a chance. A destroyer and a frigate are guarding the Mahan, and it's just been re-armed with an experimental tachyon accelerator. This won't be easy. "Hell," you gulp and think to yourself, "this won't be anything except suicidal."</text>
</event>

<event name="BOSS_TEXT_2">
	<text>One destroyer down. They weren't able to destroy you with direct firepower before, so they're likely to try drones.</text>
</event>

<event name="BOSS_TEXT_3">
	<text back="PLANET_CLOSE">All right, this is it. Just you and the big boy. The Mahan has chosen low orbit of a Pilgrim planet for the final showdown. The Admiral is likely going to deploy the tachyon accelerator now. Lights sparkle on the planet below you. Kill him.</text>

<textList name="BOSS_REPAIR_STATION">
	<text>There is a a mobile ship construction platform stationed at this beacon. After a brief exchange they give you clearance to receive emergency repairs and military supplies.</text>
	<text>An IHTG ship-yard has been converted into a military refueling station. They offer you the chance to patch up your ship and refresh some supplies.</text>
	<text>Chatter on the comm suggests the nearby Pilgrim base is outfitted with a repair station. When you forward your mission priority they quickly help repair your ship and give you some supplies.</text>
	<text>A forward construction station is in the process of repairing damaged war ships. Your command codes convince them to do a quick patch job on your ship.</text>
	<text>A trade station was abandoned nearby. Some Pilgrims engineers re-purposed their shipyard to perform military repairs. They offer to help fix your ship.</text>

<textList name="BOSS_SCOUT">
	<text>This sector is controlled by the Pilgrims, but an enemy scout has somehow slipped behind the lines. It is happily blowing the crap out of undefended supply dumps and repair stations; you should stop it before it causes any more havoc.</text>  <!--image- Fleet background-->
	<text>Long range scanners show this system is devoid of capital ships; clearly it is not of strategic value. Wait...you detect an EM burst. A loyalist ship has jumped into the system!</text> <!--image-no fleets-->
	<text>Sensors indicate that the Empire is setting up a forward Jump Beacon behind the nearby planet's moon. More importantly, a number of ships are passing by; prepare for a fight!</text> <!-- image- no fleet, empty planet-->
	<text>Pilgrim ships are scarce in this region of space despite a number of civilian space stations. You see a small bomber squadron desperately fighting off a swarm of loyalist attackers and move in to assist.</text>
	<text>As soon as you arrive at the beacon, a loyalist scout turns to engage. Power up the weapons!</text>
	<text>Your scans reveal only a small trade ship. As it draws closer, it turns out to be an Empire scout broadcasting a false signature! Bastards...you move in to attack</text>

	<text>Shots fly by your port windows followed by an Empire scout in pursuit of a damaged cruiser. Should we move in to engage?</text>
	<text>There seems to be a small Pilgrim colony under attack by a loyalist forward scout. Will you protect them?</text>
	<text>A number of large transports are being pursued by an Empire bombing squadron. One bomber has managed to slip through the defensive fire, and is poised to wreak havoc among the enormous yet vulnerable transports. There's time for you to advance and take it out!</text>
	<text>A battle rages nearby between small fighters; apparently fighting over a space station. The Pilgrims appear to be losing ships fast. Shall we assist them?</text>
	<text>A civilian ship is broadcasting a request for assistance on a secure Pilgrim channel.  They are being harassed by Empire scouts. Will you respond?</text>

	<text>It's hard to tell who is winning the nearby battle. Before you have a chance to figure it out, a corvette moves in to attack.</text>
