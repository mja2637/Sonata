	<text>The Sower rarely interact with other races unless it's necessary to complete their sacred mission to prepare the universe for the return of the Endless. Let's hope they don't construe your travel here as interference.</text>
	<text>The Sower are a robot race whose secrets remain a mystery. It is not unheard of to have a peaceful journey through their lands - but don't count on it.</text>
	<text>There's a lot of Sower activity in this sector. Sower planets are lush paradises on which most races can easily live, but the allure of their sparkling water and clear meadows is somewhat spoiled by the imposing presence of these massive robots. Since the Sower tend to ignore other races, most don't settle here due to the risk of their planets being terraformed while they're still on it.</text>

	<text>You cross paths with a Sower vessel returning from a rare diplomatic mission. Equally surprising, they are remotely pinging your ship's inventory system.</text>
	<text>You come across a Sower colony on a world in the early stages of terraformation. They must need Dust and raw materials from offworld; they are contacting your ship using the standard galactic communications protocol.</text>	
	<text>With the local Sower settlements unwilling to communicate with other life forms, an opportunistic Mantis crew has postponed its piratical activities and set up shop to catch any passing trade.</text>
	<text>A fabrication system in the lifeless husk of a massive Sower capital ship is still functioning after hundreds of thousands of years. A lively interspecies market has formed around this nucleus.</text>
	<text>You receive a hail on Pilgrim frequencies; a large Sower colony running metastrategic subroutines seemed to have decided to trade with you. You are wary, but robots are not known for being deceitful.</text>

	<text>You jump into the middle of a Sower excavation project on a nearby moon. Unimpressed with your intrusion they move to defend themselves!</text>
	<text>You intercept Sower interprocess communications - they are remote method calls to military subroutines! There is no talking to these guys.</text>
	<text>It looks quiet, but you realize your computer is being scanned. A hidden Sower vessel attempts to erase certain ship log entries, but when your crew denies write access they open fire.</text>
	<text>You notice a Sower ship performing combat exercises. However, they quickly change their course to engage your ship. They apparently treat unregistered alien ships as handy target practice. </text>
