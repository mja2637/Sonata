</event>
<textList name="START_BEACON_ZOLTAN">
	<text>You've entered Sophon territory. They have not yet recognized the Pilgrims as an independent nation, but they've cast a blind eye towards the resistance in the past.</text>
	<text>The Sophon patrol their borders but let you pass when you ID as Pilgrim. Let's hope they won't be so courteous to the United Empire.</text>
	<text>You arrive in Sophon space. From what you have heard they remain politically neutral, unwilling to risk alienating the Pilgrims or the powerful United Empire.</text>
	<text>You're far from Pilgrim home space here in Sophon territory, and it's not clear whether the authorities will have any goodwill remaining. Still, you have to push forward.</text>
</textList>

<event name="STORE_ZOLTAN">
	<text load="STORE_ZOLTAN"/>
	<store/>
</event>
<textList name="STORE_ZOLTAN">
	<text>The Sophon are fascinated by other species, and have set up something of an alien knick-knack shop here. Why not take a look?</text>
	<text>An IHTG trade ship hails: "My friends! Please, there is nothing I don't have, and there is nothing worth wanting that I can't get. Why not take a look around my shop?"</text>
	<text>A Mantis crew here has hunkered down in the abdomen of a long-dead space-whale - the only way, presumably, for them to operate their black-market trade without detection. Worth a look?</text>
	
	
</textList>

<event name="NOTHING_ZOLTAN">
	<text load="NOTHING_ZOLTAN"/>
</event>
<textList name="NOTHING_ZOLTAN">
	<text>There are some mineral-rich asteroids here that the Sophon have left idle, but you've none of the necessary equipment to mine them.</text>
	<text>You have to admit - Sophon space is a beautiful and peaceful place indeed. However, re-engaging the FTL and finishing your mission is your priority, not sight-seeing.</text>
	<text>A light asteroid field is entering the atmosphere of a nearby planet - a fireworks show on a galactic scale. There's little for it but to take in the ambiance and program the next jump.</text>
	<!-- TO DO - need more -->
	<text>You stumble upon some Sophon military vessels engaging in combat training. Their Energy Shields are impressive, but you note how quickly beam and ion weaponry take them down.</text>
	<text>You don't have time to hail the Sophon ship that was waiting at this beacon before it jumps away. They are an aloof race.</text>
	<text>A Sophon orbital research park is stationed at this beacon. You admire the beautiful architecture of the station, but its massive power signature makes you nervous. Time to move on.</text>
	<text>A message broadcast from a nearby planet announces the presence of an ancient Sophon university available for visiting. Likely just a tourist trap, but still too bad you don't have the time to visit.</text>

<event name="ZOLTAN_DISTRESS_SHELL" unique="true">
	<text>You arrive to find a massive Sophon freighter with no one at the helm. It's a mystery what happened to the crew, but it'd be a shame to let the opportunity go to waste.</text>

	<text>You discover a number of Sophon civilian ships fighting off pirates. Unfortunately one ship mistakes your purpose and moves in to attack! They are refusing all communication; you have no choice but to fight.</text>
	<text>Like many areas in Sophon space, the residents of this sector prepared well for Galactic war. The military here seem to have given up reasoning with foreigners, preferring instead to attack on sight!</text>
	<text>A Sophon ship is waiting at this beacon. They request your identification, but radiation from the sun in this system is disrupting your communications. They take your silence for aggression and move in to attack.</text>
