<!--
Matt: This sector contains the Stealth Ship unlock. I'm unsure what to replace it with atm.

The Engi don't map neatly to any ES races (since the Sower are taken). Horatio/Amoeba/Cravers don't really fit, and I see those as races to be introduced in Minuet anyway. I may map them to the Automatons, but we already have a robot race and I really don't think that the Automatons are a compelling race. Perhaps they'll be getting their asses terminally kicked by the Hissho as the game opens.

Thusly think I will mostly remove the Engi, perhaps keeping a few around as a Hissho slave race. To that end, the Engi sector should be repurposed to do exposition on Hissho-Human relations (potentially WRT the Hissho-Automaton war, perhaps with implications of the French-Indian War a la Assassin's Creed 3?)

	<text>You have arrived in Automaton space. The Hissho invasion has been threatening the Automaton core worlds. The Automatons are friendly, but they can't guarantee your safety any more.</text>
	<text>You have arrived in Automaton space. The secession war and the Hissho invasion has brought tough times for these robotic lifeforms, but they're usually willing to help.</text>

<textList name="STORE_ENGI">
	<text>The Automatons can do remarkable things with nothing but metal and Dust. The community at this beacon is selling equipment for just that.</text>
	<text>A message arrives: "Your Dust, ours. Our weapons for you." You're about to raise the shields when you realise it's just an Automaton trader looking for a trade.</text>
	<text>An Automaton ship hails: "Engine upgrade necessary for travel home. Sale of equipment necessary for engine upgrade."</text>

	<text>The complex arrangements of ship hulls and FTL drive capacitors floating abandoned in space suggest the Automatons were here not too long ago, but no longer.</text>
	<text>You arrive at a green planet with great plains and rolling waterfalls. During peacetime, the Automatons would have cherished this environment. Since the Hissho invasion, this planet must have been of too little strategic value to defend.</text> <!-- JUSTIN TO DO- MAKE GREEN PLANET-->
	<text>You have arrived near an Automaton colony. They have been constructing a sort of living shipyard, but you can tell that the Hissho have attacked it again and again. It is barely maintaining structural integrity; you get the sense that the structure itself is in pain.</text>
	<text>Even though each "individual" Automaton is made up of trillions of nano-machines, their culture still revolves around traditional social interactions. A nearby station seems to be constructed for entertainment of passing Automatons.</text>
	<text>You see a number of Automaton space stations and fleets nearby. Despite looking like piles of junk loosely tied together they are actually a model of efficiency. They just lack a certain aesthetic emphasis in their constructions.</text>
	<text>This system appears quite peaceful. You're not sure how long it'll last against the Hissho blitz.</text>
	<text>There are a number of merchant ships passing through the area despite the threat of Hissho invasion. No doubt they are interested in buying the unique, strangely organic products made by the Automatons.</text>
	<text>You see a small UE carrier in the distance. You lay low and try to blend in with the other traffic. It's surprising to see a human military ship alone deep in Automaton space.</text>
	<text>The Automaton seem to have avoided this particular node, along with every other life-form. You keep your eyes peeled for reasons why, but spin up the FTL without event.</text>
	<text>A cluster of Automaton satellites in orbit of a nearby planet are the only clue the Automatons were ever here. The planet is burning...</text>

	<text>You make contact with an isolated Automaton science station who are staying put despite the likelihood of Hissho invasion. They suggest you trial some experimental technology.</text>

	<text>You jump in near a small United Empire ship. A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own; he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something. He's not going to be around long enough to tell anyone about you.</text>
