Sower:

Segment 1 - Attempt to communicate
	1 You found a usable API early on - you can send simple messages such as "Guard" or "Repair", and the Sower was able and willing to do it. There's a higher-level language inside the kernel, worked into everything. You think you will eventually find a way to interface with it; it's just a matter of time.	
	2 Your Sower discovered and began using your ship computer's declared services remarkably fast. It recently began to output status messages to crewmember terminals - simple enumerations like "SYSTEM_REPAIR_TASK_SUCC_EN" and "O2_IN_NORM := true". It's learning.
	2a Presumably, the Sower intelligence is a combination of programming and empiric data - nature and nuture. Without a way to rewrite their own progamming, though, Sower can only learn so much. Since you've observed drastic deviations from typical Sower behavior, there must be something deeper.
	3 It had rapidly pinged one of your ship's unused databases, so you started dumping simple data and function pointers into it in hopes of a communications breakthrough. After figuring out how to fling simple alphanumeric messages at one another, the Sower has started populating one column with code in an odd high-level language.
	3a As best you can determine, this code poses no threat to your ship's systems. It seems to involve decision-making and experiencial behavior adjustment; you'll need to study it further in order to make any use of it.
Segment 2 - The concept of 'I'
	1 "unit_identifier(_). unit_identifier(n,[H|sow]) :- member(H)." The terminal simply prints "true."; you quickly debug your code and try again. The Sower sends you what appears to be a process ID. After hastily adding a few additional enumerations linked to an English dictionary, you submit another query:
	1question "is_name(pid) := unique(pid), pid is 5834608."
	1a "true."
	2 While passing a Sower terraformer, your ship's ECW console lights up: your Sower is transmitting to the other ship! Acting hastily, you record the transmission and analyze the packet content. Surprisingly, they have a fundamentally different structure to your Sower's internal messages.
	2a This may be conclusive proof that Sower handle internal and external communications differently; is that enough for individuality? Your Sower just transmitted a short status message to the other ship. You wonder if they're jsut saying "Hey, how are you?" - strangers in the night.
	3 You've been steadily adding functions to the database in the Sower's own high-level language, at first simple chores like "clean-lavatory" and "polish-captains-boots". On a whim, you've decided to tackle more personal jobs - "respond-greeting-hello".
	3a The Sower updates the database almost instantly. The code has been altered - a line inserted. (let (lambda(crwName) (display "RECEIVE_MSG " crwName " RECEIVER_ID " pid))) Perhaps it is merely complying with internal coding standards. But what if it's saying "Hi, my name is RECEIVER_ID"?
Segment 3 - Thoughts on Humanity
	1 You hit the macro to order your Sower to take a break from duty, and it responds on your console: "RECEIVE_MSG GENERIC_INPUT". It often "says" RECEIVE_MSG as a form of greeting or acknowledgement - but what is GENERIC_INPUT?
	1question "Man GENERIC_INPUT"
	1a The Sower responds: "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN\nalias \"Captain\"\t95 percent of input" Is it laughing? It must have named you GENERIC_INPUT internally because you talk to it so much! You don't know whether to be amazed or offended.
	2 Occasionally, the Sower will respond to a query with relatively verbose output. It answers to the strangest things - reactor temperature charts, raw sensor data, dubstep - but through clever selection you can converse with it. 
	2question Allow it to sample your music library
	2a When you attempt to copy your ship's music database into the Sower, you are denied permission - the files already exist. You perform some diagnostics; the Sower has spent trillions of processor cycles playing jazz. Logs indicate that the folder /skrillex has been overwritten with whitespace 8 times.
	3 After a hard day working on the aft thrust couplers, you are exhausted and covered in sweat. A low mechanical whirr announces your Sower's presence; it presents you with a hydration packet and displays a message on a nearby terminal - "SUFFICIENT EFFICIENCY".
	3question "Thanks."
	3a Did you just thank a robot? You've noticed that it spends more time around other crewmembers than not, sometimes following them from room to room. You wonder if it has learned to be loyal to you.
Segment 4 - Duty
	1 You can now communicate with the Sower in plain text, for the most part - it's actually quite talkative at lower log severity levels. Since you're nearly at the end of your journey, you feel able to risk waxing philosophical with it.
	1question "Will we be victorious?"
	1a "OBJECTIVES MET." That raised an eyebrow. You query - "OBJECTIVES?" - and realize that you had never specified a military victory. Eyes wet, you read its response: "[LIFE, LIBERTY, p_HAPPINESS]". Could a Sower ever realize what those words mean to you?
	2 It is refreshing to see the world through the eyes of a robot; it is like talking to a great philosopher and a child at the same time. Late one night alone at the controls, you decide to strike up a conversation.
	2questiona You type. "ps -a" What're you thinking about?
	2answera It responds. "root 1 98.1 5.5 99:99" A whole lot of jack shit.
	2questionb You type. "cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state" Tired? How're you doing?
	2answerb It responds. "present: yes capacity state: ok charging state: charged present rate: 1.3 gWh/s" Just fine. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
	2questionc You type. "man humanity" So...humans, amIright?
	2questionb It responds. "true. <unknown_parameters> false. !null. Exception in current_thread.future: INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUNDS"  Humanity is confusing, mysterious - anything and everything except insignificant. Prospects for its future are both unknown and unlimited.
	2end You smile. Its words, not yours.
	3 Only a few jumps away from Pilgrim command, you resolve to thank your Sower crewmember in a fit of intense humanity. He's been with you for a while now; as much a part of the crew as anyone. One late night, you throw together an elegant high-level function you think will get the message across.
	3question Send it.
	3answer "ltl univ {[]<>!(!self && !self.behavior)} You translate; the Sower is saying that it can never be other than itself - that it could not do other than it has done and will continue to do. The Sower's CPU usage rate is higher than you have ever seen it before.
	3a The cursor blinks; it's still thinking. After several seconds text appears on your terminal. "It has been my pleasure to serve with you, Captain."
